            <h2>History of the Internet in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>The internet was introduced to the Philippines in the early 1990s. The first connection was established on March 29, 1994, marking the country's official entry into the global network. This was made possible through the efforts of institutions like the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and academic organizations.</p>
